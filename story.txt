Story!

I was at the market and everyone was rushing to get some Bratwust (Sausage), I hurried and just as I reached for it I heard the sound of my ledehose (leather pants) spliting. 
I whipped up as I heard the ripping sound, and quickly I grabbed a pack of Bratwurst. As I turned around, I noticed someone's service dog (Hund) was staring at me and immediately
I thought to myself, "Is the dog staring at my ripped pants or the applie pie (Apfelkuchen) in my hands?".
