Story!

I was at the market and everyone was rushing to get some Bratwust (Sausage),
 I hurried and just as I reached for it I heard the sound of my ledehose (leather pants) spliting.
I whipped up as I heard the ripping sound, and quickly I grabbed a pack of Bratwurst.
 As I turned around, I noticed someone's service dog (Hund) was staring at me and immediately
I thought to myself, "Is the dog staring at my ripped pants or the applie pie (Apfelkuchen)
 in my hands?". Then I remembered, just last week I wore these ledehose (leather pants)
  to the Rammstein (German band) concert at which it hit me that they played feuer frei
   and the crowd went crazy. In the crowd, I remembered turning around to see my friend
    professor Mehlhase (also known as flour bunny in german) who was so excited to see
     me that she spilled her beer on my ledehose.. now I knew why the service dog was so intrigued with
      the scents on my ledgehose. I had spill beer during the on myself during the stein hold
      in the Biergarten (beer garden).
