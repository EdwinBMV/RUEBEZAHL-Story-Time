]Story!

I was at the market and everyone was rushing to get some Bratwust (Sausage),
 I hurried and just as I reached for it I heard the sound of my ledehose (leather pants) spliting.
I whipped up as I heard the ripping sound, and quickly I grabbed a pack of Bratwurst.
 As I turned around, I noticed someone's service dog (Hund) was staring at me and immediately
I thought to myself, "Is the dog staring at my ripped pants or the applie pie (Apfelkuchen)
 in my hands?". Then I remembered, just last week I wore these ledehose (leather pants)
  to the Rammstein (German band) concert at which it hit me that they played feuer frei
   and the crowd went crazy. In the crowd, I remembered turning around to see my friend
    professor Mehlhase (also known as flour bunny in german) who was so excited to see
     me that she spilled her beer on my ledehose.. now I knew why the service dog was so intrigued with
      the scents on my ledgehose. I had spill beer during the on myself during the stein hold
      in the Biergarten (beer garden). I tried to go into the Baeckerei(bakery) to find something to
      dry myself, but after I did, I noticed that someone had put a Schloss(lock) outside of the door trapping me in.
     Then I really wish I had a doener kebab, but I am locked inside. Desperate and trapped, I grabbed a loaf of brot (bread) off 
the shelf to sit on while i figured out how to escape. Days have passed, for some reason the only thing I have to eat is this doener kebab with not a single pastry(gebaek) inside this bakery(baeckerei).
Suddenly, I heard a loud noise from above, and through a small window on the ceiling, I saw a Porsche being lifted by a helicopter landing at the Flughafen (airport) nearby. Its a good thing that I had Klimaanlage (air conditioning) on, seeing all this stuff going on outside would be making me sweat. 
Just as I was thinking about my escape, a man in a Dirndel (traditional feminine dress) driving a BMW motorcycle, was yelling that the Schloss (lock) is being removed.
So I left to go to a City Hall's Ratskeller where he lives, down Hauptstrasse, so I can report to the mayor who lives in the City Hall's Hauptstrasse to repor what I had done today.
